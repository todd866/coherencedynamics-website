The standard textbook story of human social evolution goes something like this: for most of our 300,000-year history, *Homo sapiens* lived in small, mobile, egalitarian bands. We roamed the savanna, hunting game and gathering plants. Complexity---hierarchy, sedentism, division of labor---only emerged after the Neolithic Revolution, when agriculture forced us into villages and gave rise to surplus, property, and power.

It's a clean narrative. It's also probably wrong.

A [2022 paper by Singh and Glowacki](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2022.07.003) in *Evolution and Human Behavior* systematically dismantles this "nomadic-egalitarian model" using comparative ethnography and a growing archaeological record. Their conclusion: **social complexity didn't require agriculture. It required predictable resources.** And the most predictable resources in the Late Pleistocene weren't on land---they were in the water.

## The Evidence: Barnacles, Middens, and Deep-Sea Fish

Consider what archaeologists have found at Pinnacle Point, South Africa, dated to around 160,000 years ago: whale barnacles. These are parasites that only attach to living whales. Their presence at a coastal site means early humans were processing whale carcasses---and possibly hunting them, or at least towing them. You don't get a whale to the beach without a plan and a rope.

By 130,000 years ago, shell middens (accumulated piles of shellfish remains) appear across multiple African coastlines. These aren't the traces of opportunistic beachcombers. They're the signatures of *sedentary* populations systematically exploiting marine resources.

The pattern repeats globally. Wherever we find "dense, rich, and predictable" aquatic resources---salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest, maritime environments in Tierra del Fuego, coastal shell beds---we find low-mobility foragers with complex social organization: food storage, wealth inequality, hereditary leadership, and elaborate ritual.

Singh and Glowacki call this the "diverse histories model." The Late Pleistocene wasn't a uniform sea of wandering egalitarians. It was a mosaic---with some groups living the classic nomadic lifestyle, and others already building proto-complex societies around coastal and riverine resource bases.

## The Cyborg Hypothesis

Here's where it gets interesting. Exploiting marine resources requires *technology*: boats, nets, hooks, harpoons, fish traps. You can't wade out to harvest pelagic fish or process a whale carcass with your bare hands.

This creates a feedback loop:

1. **Rich marine ecology** → enables sedentism and social complexity
2. **Social complexity** → enables specialization and technological innovation
3. **Better technology** → unlocks new ecological niches
4. **Repeat**

But this isn't just a chicken-and-egg story about tools. It's a claim about *what we are*.

**The Aquatic Cyborg Hypothesis:** Early *Homo sapiens* didn't just *use* maritime technology; we *co-evolved* with it. The boat wasn't a tool we invented after becoming cognitively modern. The boat---and the maritime adaptation it enabled---may have been part of what *made* us cognitively modern.

Think of the boat as an **exosomatic organelle**: an extension of the body that isn't genetically encoded, but is just as essential to the organism's phenotype as any organ. The relationship isn't organism → tool. It's organism + tool = functional unit. (This is why current "tool-use" AI benchmarks miss the point: they test the tool, not the coupling.)

## The Steering Problem

This is where coherence dynamics enters the picture.

In my [previous post](/blog/coherence-dynamics-circa-1890), I argued that consciousness arises from a system's ability to *steer* through a high-dimensional state space. The "soup" (electrochemical dynamics) provides the terrain; the "sparks" (neural codes) provide the steering.

The Aquatic Cyborg hypothesis extends this logic to the evolutionary scale.

A terrestrial primate has a certain number of behavioral degrees of freedom: it can walk, climb, forage, fight, flee, socialize. Its "state space" is constrained by its anatomy and its environment.

Now give that primate a boat.

Suddenly, the accessible state space *expands dramatically*. New resources (pelagic fish, marine mammals, distant islands) become reachable. New social configurations (sedentary villages, stored surplus, division of labor) become viable. New cognitive demands (navigation, seasonal timing, complex tool maintenance) become selectable.

The technology doesn't just *add* options. It *transforms the topology* of the organism's behavioral manifold.

Consider the difference between **terrestrial steering** and **marine steering**. On land, you steer against *friction*---gravity, terrain, static obstacles. At sea, you steer against *flow*---currents, wind, waves. Steering against flow requires a higher-dimensional internal model. You must predict vectors, not just positions. You must anticipate how the environment will move, not just where it is.

The boat didn't just expand *where* our ancestors could go. It forced a cognitive upgrade in *how* they modeled the world---from static obstacle-avoidance to dynamic flow-prediction. New dimensions of freedom, new dimensions of cognition.

## The Low-D Controller / High-D Terrain Pattern

Notice the structure: a relatively **low-dimensional intervention** (building a boat) unlocks a **high-dimensional expansion** (new ecological and social possibilities).

This is the same pattern we see in:

- **Neurons and fields:** Low-D spike codes steer high-D electrochemical dynamics
- **Genomes and development:** Low-D genetic sequences steer high-D morphogenetic fields
- **Rituals and societies:** Low-D symbolic acts steer high-D social coordination

The boat is a low-D physical object. But it's a *control interface* to a high-D space of possibilities. The early human who lashed together the first raft didn't just build a transportation device. They built a **dimensional amplifier**.

## What This Means for the "Human Revolution"

Archaeologists have long puzzled over the sudden appearance of "behaviorally modern" traits around 50,000 years ago: art, ornamentation, long-distance trade, complex burial practices. The standard explanation invokes a cognitive mutation---some neural rewiring that unlocked symbolic thought.

But maybe the revolution wasn't in the brain. Maybe it was in the *extended system*.

If maritime technology had been accumulating for 100,000+ years, gradually expanding the accessible state space, then the "revolution" might simply be the point where the system crossed a threshold---where the accumulated dimensional expansion became archaeologically visible as "complexity."

The brain didn't suddenly become capable of art. The brain + tools + social structure + ecological niche finally reached a configuration where art became *selectable*.

## The Egalitarian Myth

This reframes the political implications of human evolution.

If the "natural" human state were egalitarian nomadism, then hierarchy is a deviation---an imposition, a fall from grace. Many political philosophies (left and right) implicitly rely on this assumption.

But if Singh and Glowacki are right, there was never a single "natural" state. Our ancestors were diverse. Some were mobile and egalitarian. Some were sedentary and hierarchical. The difference wasn't cognitive or moral---it was *ecological*.

Hierarchy isn't a corruption of human nature. Egalitarianism isn't our default. Both are solutions to different environmental and technological configurations.

This doesn't resolve political questions about how we *should* organize society. But it does suggest that appeals to "human nature" are less informative than we thought. We're not fallen egalitarians. We're not natural hierarchists. We're **cyborgs**---organisms whose nature is inseparable from our technological and ecological context.

## What Would Prove Me Wrong?

If the Aquatic Cyborg hypothesis is correct, we should expect:

- **Archaeological evidence** of maritime technology predating "behavioral modernity." (The whale barnacles at Pinnacle Point are suggestive, but we need more.)
- **Comparative patterns** showing that maritime-adapted populations worldwide independently develop similar social complexity signatures, controlling for other variables.
- **Cognitive traces** of maritime adaptation in modern human psychology---perhaps specialized intuitions for navigation, seasonal timing, or fluid mechanics that aren't easily explained by savanna ecology.

If maritime technology was incidental to human evolution, we shouldn't see these patterns. If it was foundational, we should.
