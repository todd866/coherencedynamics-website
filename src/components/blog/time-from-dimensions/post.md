## Part I: Without the Math

> **TL;DR:** Time emerges from correlations through a dimensional aperture. When the aperture contracts—whether from gravity, velocity, or neural synchronization—time dilates. This isn't three separate phenomena. It's one phenomenon in three regimes.

This is Part 3 of a series. [Part 1](/blog/quantum-mechanics-without-math) reframed quantum mechanics as projection from high-dimensional states. [Part 2](/blog/quantum-gravity-without-the-paradox) applied that to gravity, arguing that classical spacetime is the map, not the territory.

Now we ask: what about time?

### The pattern

In the [previous post](/blog/quantum-gravity-without-the-paradox), we noticed something:

**Black holes:**
- External observer sees the horizon as a 2D surface (k=2)
- External observer sees infalling objects freeze in time
- Infalling observer sees smooth 3D space (k=3)
- Infalling observer experiences normal time flow

**High velocity:**
- Length contracts in the direction of travel (spatial dimension squashes)
- Time dilates proportionally
- Co-moving observer sees normal space
- Co-moving observer experiences normal time

The pattern: **when k drops, time slows.**

This isn't a coincidence. It's a relationship.

### Time from correlations

In the Wheeler-DeWitt formulation of quantum gravity, the universal wavefunction satisfies:

$$\hat{H}|\Psi\rangle = 0$$

The universe is "frozen." There's no time parameter in the fundamental equation.

So where does our experience of time come from?

**From correlations.** When a subsystem S is entangled with a "clock" subsystem C, the correlations between them look like time evolution from S's perspective. Time is not fundamental—it emerges from the pattern of correlations between subsystems.

But here's the key: **you can only correlate with degrees of freedom you have access to.**

The dimensional aperture k determines how many degrees of freedom are accessible. When k drops, you lose access to degrees of freedom. Fewer accessible degrees of freedom → fewer possible correlations → slower time.

---

### The unified picture

| Regime | What happens to k | What happens to time | Why |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Black hole (external) | k: 3→2 at horizon | Freezes | Can only see the surface |
| High velocity | k contracts in travel direction | Dilates | One dimension squashed |
| Infalling / co-moving | k unchanged | Normal flow | Full access maintained |
| Sleep (slow waves) | k pinches (neural sync) | Subjective time stops | Dimensional bottleneck |
| Flow states | k narrows (focused attention) | Time distortion | Reduced peripheral access |
| Psychedelics | k expands | Time stretches/fragments | Too many degrees of freedom |

The claim: **these are all instances of the same relationship.**

Time = rate of correlation accumulation through the dimensional aperture

Squeeze the aperture → reduce correlation rate → dilate time

### Why this makes sense

Think about what "time passing" actually means operationally:
- Recording memories
- Updating states based on interactions
- Accumulating correlations with your environment

All of these require access to degrees of freedom. If your dimensional aperture contracts, you can interact with fewer degrees of freedom per unit of coordinate time. From your perspective, less happens. Time slows.

This is why:
- The external observer sees the infalling astronaut freeze—they've lost access to the degrees of freedom that would let them see further evolution
- The astronaut experiences normal time—their aperture is unchanged, they're still correlating with their local environment
- You lose time during deep sleep—your neural dimensionality collapses, correlations aren't being formed
- Flow states distort time—narrowed attention means fewer peripheral correlations

---

### The aperture is observer-relative

A crucial point: k is not a property of spacetime alone. It's a property of the observer-system relationship.

The black hole horizon is k=2 for the external observer and k=3 for the infalling observer. Neither is wrong. The aperture depends on your embedding in the system.

This is black hole complementarity—and it generalizes. Your dimensional aperture is determined by:
- Your trajectory through spacetime (velocity, gravitational field)
- Your measurement apparatus (what degrees of freedom you couple to)
- Your neural state (attention, synchronization, neurochemistry)

Different observers can have different k for the same underlying physics.

---

### What this doesn't explain

Let me be clear about limits:

**We don't have a derivation.** The k-time relationship is a pattern, not (yet) a theorem. I'm claiming the correlation is real and meaningful, not that I've derived it from first principles.

**The exponent is unknown.** Is time dilation proportional to k? To k²? To log(k)? The functional form needs to be worked out.

**Neural "time" is slippery.** Subjective time distortion isn't the same as physical time dilation. The analogy may be structural rather than identical.

**This is speculative.** The relativistic cases (black holes, velocity) are established physics with established math. The claim that they're instances of a more general dimensional principle is the new part.

## Part II: With the Math

### Relativistic time dilation (established)

In general relativity, proper time τ relates to coordinate time t via the metric:

$$d\tau^2 = -g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu$$

For a stationary observer in Schwarzschild spacetime:

$$\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}$$

At the horizon (r = 2GM/c²), this goes to zero. Time freezes.

In special relativity, the Lorentz factor:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$

gives both length contraction (L = L₀/γ) and time dilation (Δt = γΔt₀).

The question is: can we express these as dimensional aperture effects?

### Dimensional aperture (proposed)

Define the effective dimensionality k_eff via a participation ratio over accessible degrees of freedom:

$$k_{eff} = \frac{(\sum_i \lambda_i)^2}{\sum_i \lambda_i^2}$$

where λᵢ are the eigenvalues of some relevant operator (metric eigenvalues for spacetime, covariance eigenvalues for neural states).

The conjecture:

$$\frac{d\tau}{dt} \propto \left(\frac{k_{eff}}{k_{max}}\right)^\alpha$$

for some exponent α.

### Connecting to the metric

The spacetime volume element is √(-g)d⁴x, where g is the metric determinant.

In Schwarzschild:

$$\sqrt{-g} = r^2 \sin\theta \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}$$

The radial factor √(1 - 2GM/rc²) appears in both the volume element and the time dilation factor.

Conjecture: **the metric determinant encodes the dimensional aperture.** When √(-g) → 0, dimensions are "squeezing" and time freezes.

For Lorentz contraction, the spatial volume contracts by 1/γ in the direction of motion. The "accessible spatial volume" decreases, and time dilates by the same factor γ.

### Neural dimensional time (speculative)

For neural dynamics, define:

$$D_{eff} = \frac{(\text{tr } C)^2}{\text{tr } C^2}$$

where C is the covariance matrix of neural activity.

Hypothesis:

$$\frac{d\tau_{subjective}}{dt} \propto D_{eff}^\beta$$

for some exponent β.

Testable predictions:
- During slow-wave sleep (low D_eff), subjective time should be minimal
- During psychedelic states (high D_eff), subjective time should stretch or fragment
- During focused attention (reduced D_eff), time distortion should occur

### Information geometry connection

The Fisher information metric on a statistical manifold defines a natural notion of "distance" between states:

$$ds^2 = g_{ij}(\theta)d\theta^i d\theta^j$$

The volume element √(det g) determines how much "space" is available for states to differ.

Conjecture: **time flow ∝ geodesic velocity through Fisher space**, which depends on √(det g).

When the Fisher volume contracts (dimensional collapse), geodesic motion slows. Time emerges from motion through state space; when the space itself contracts, motion slows.

This connects to the [minimal embedding dimension paper](/papers/minimal-embedding)—the minimum dimensionality needed to represent dynamics faithfully.

### Thermodynamic angle

Entropy production rate:

$$\dot{S} = \frac{dS}{dt}$$

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, systems produce entropy as they evolve. When dimensional access is reduced, entropy production channels are cut off.

Conjecture: **time flow ∝ entropy production capacity**, which scales with accessible dimensions.

This connects to the [dimensional Landauer bound](in preparation)—the thermodynamic cost of dimensional reduction.

## The Punchline

Time is not a backdrop on which physics happens. Time is a measure of correlation accumulation through dimensional apertures.

When the aperture squeezes—whether from gravity, velocity, or neural synchronization—correlation rate drops. From the inside, time slows.

This reframes several classic puzzles:
- **Twin paradox:** The traveling twin's dimensional aperture is contracted; they accumulate fewer correlations; they age less.
- **Black hole information:** The external observer's aperture closes at the horizon; they can't see further correlations; time freezes.
- **Subjective time distortion:** Neural aperture varies with brain state; subjective time varies accordingly.

The math is not complete. But the pattern is clear:

> **Squeeze k, slow time.**

**One-sentence synthesis:**
